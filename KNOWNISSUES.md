#KOBA known issues


# Development

__Admin__

* When refreshing resources, resources that are deleted in the AD are not removed from the KOBA list. If a resource is removed in future releases, make sure it is removed from the ApiKey configurations as well.
* The remember me checkbox (login) has no effect.
* When selecting "KOBA" as display mode for a resource, the code does not handle a mix of bookings made through KOBA and Exchange (this needs further development).
